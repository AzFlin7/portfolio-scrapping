Attempt to give a better insight into the impact of adding cryptocurrencies to potential portfolio perfomance.


## Objectives
Find a way to build an effective montecarlo model for altcoins.

Explore the value of cryptocurrency asset class in a porttfolio and allow users to see the risks of high crypto allocation and potential upside of even a small percent stake.
